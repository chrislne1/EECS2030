# Java Object-Oriented Programming Labs

This repository contains a collection of Java labs focused on object-oriented design, abstraction, and manual data management under strict programming constraints. Each lab is fully specified using JUnit tests.



## Lab 1: App Store Simulation
**About:**  
Simulates a simplified app store where apps can be published, installed, and reviewed by users.

**Skills Used:**  
- Object-oriented class design  
- Encapsulation and access control  
- Object interaction and state tracking  
- Array-based storage (no collections)  
- Constraint-driven logic and validation  



## Lab 2: Vaccination Tracker System
**About:**  
Simulates vaccine distribution, appointment booking, and patient health records.

**Skills Used:**  
- Object interaction across multiple classes  
- State tracking and updates  
- Custom exceptions  
- Order-preserving arrays  
- Constraint-based logic  



## Lab 3: Building Blueprint System
**About:**  
Models building units, floors, and multi-floor blueprints with strict space and capacity constraints.

**Skills Used:**  
- Object-oriented design and encapsulation  
- Equality (`equals`) implementation  
- Defensive copying  
- Custom exception handling  
- Manual array management  



## Lab 4: Channel–Follower Video Platform
**About:**  
Models channels, subscribers, and monitors with video release and viewing statistics.

**Skills Used:**  
- Inheritance and method overriding  
- Observer-style object relationships  
- State synchronization across objects  
- Statistical tracking and formatting  
- Encapsulation without collections  



## Lab 5: Sequence Expression Evaluator
**About:**  
Implements a framework for evaluating operations over integer sequences using interchangeable evaluators.

**Skills Used:**  
- Interfaces and abstract classes  
- Inheritance and dynamic binding  
- Algorithm design using arrays  
- Compatibility checking and exceptions  
- Polymorphic object behavior
