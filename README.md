# App Store Simulation

## Project Overview
This project implements a simplified **App Store system** in Java. It simulates how apps are released, updated, rated, downloaded, and managed by users across different regional app stores. The system models core app store functionality such as version tracking, update logs, user accounts, and ratings without relying on Java collection libraries.

The project is designed using object-oriented principles and is fully validated using **JUnit tests**, which serve as both documentation and verification of correct behavior.



## Key Features
- App version management with detailed update logs
- User rating system with average scores and rating breakdowns
- Support for multiple regional app stores
- Account system for downloading, uninstalling, and rating apps
- Detection of stable apps based on update history



## Skills & Concepts Used
- Object-Oriented Programming (encapsulation, associations, responsibility-driven design)
- Primitive and reference-typed arrays for data management
- JUnit testing for behavior-driven development
- String formatting and manual data aggregation
- Software design inferred from test specifications



## Testing
All functionality is verified using **JUnit test cases**, which define the expected behavior of:
- App update logs
- App release and rating logic
- App store management
- Account download, uninstall, and rating workflows

These tests act as the primary specification for the system’s design and behavior.
